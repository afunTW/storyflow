Final Project for coursera


About the projectï¼š

All of things have their own story. 

Sometimes we have something unused but it also has their value and charming. 
We hope the things can find the new place and keep on helping people.
According to the Six Degrees of Separation which is the theory that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away,
by way of introduction, from any other person in the world,
so that a chain of "a friend of a friend" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps.
It was originally set out by Frigyes Karinthy and popularized by a play written by John Guare.

So, we hope everyone through sharing their stories (of product) to other people. 
Therefore, everyone connect each other less than six people and make the global links closer.
